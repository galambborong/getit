## Introduction

This is a reddit-like news/content-sharing site. This repository is the front end of the project. You can view the back end repository [here](https://github.com/galambborong/pk-nc-news).

## See it in action

I plan to host this project live imminently. In the meantime, however, please follow the following steps. Note, this project was built using Node v14.15.3.

1. Clone the repo
2. Within the directory `pk-nc-news-fe`, run `npm i` to install all dependencies
3. Once this has completed, run `npm start`. This will open a new tab in your browser

## Technology stack

This site is built using

- **React** using
- **Reach Router** for routing components to certain paths,
- **Axios** for fetching all the data from the API, and
- **Sass / CSS** for styling, using the **BEM** method
